# BIP32-Ed25519-Swift

A Swift implementation of ARC-0052 Algorand, in accordance with the paper BIP32-Ed25519 Hierarchical Deterministic Keys over a Non-linear Keyspace.

Note that this library has NOT undergone audit and is NOT recommended for production use.

## Generating Keys

To initialize a wallet (using MnemmonicSwift for BIP-39 support) from a seed phrase:

```swift
import bip32_ed25519_swift
import MnemonicSwift
let seed = try Mnemonic.deterministicSeedString(from: "salon zoo engage submit smile frost later decide wing sight chaos renew lizard rely canal coral scene hobby scare step bus leaf tobacco slice")
let c = Bip32Ed25519(seed: seed)
```

Now you can generate keys using a BIP-44 derivation path:

```swift
let pk = c.keyGen(context: KeyContext.Address, account: 0, change: 0, keyIndex: 0)
```

To sign an Algorand transaction, you can use the signAlgoTransaction.

```swift
let prefixEncodedTx = Data(base64Encoded: "VFiJo2FtdM0D6KNmZWXNA+iiZnbOAkeSd6NnZW6sdGVzdG5ldC12MS4womdoxCBIY7UYpLPITsgQ8i1PEIHLD3HwWaesIN7GL39w5Qk6IqJsds4CR5Zfo3JjdsQgYv6DK3rRBUS+gzemcENeUGSuSmbne9eJCXZbRrV2pvOjc25kxCBi/oMretEFRL6DN6ZwQ15QZK5KZud714kJdltGtXam86R0eXBlo3BheQ==")
let sig = c.signAlgoTransaction(context: KeyContext.Address, account: 0, change: 0, keyIndex: 0, prefixEncodedTx: prefixEncodedTx)
```

Where prefixEncodedTx is a transaction that has been compiled with the SDK's transaction builder. The signature returned can be verified against the public key:

```swift
c.verifyWithPublicKey(signature: sig, message: prefixEncodedTx, publicKey: pk)
```
